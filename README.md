# Custom-Event-Scheduler-Full-Stack-Web-App

This project is a full-stack web application designed to help users schedule events with complex recurrence patterns. The application provides a user-friendly interface for defining custom recurrence rules, such as "Every third Thursday of the month" or "The last weekday of the year." It includes both a backend, built with Node.js, and a frontend, built with React.

## Features

- User authentication (login and registration)
- Create, edit, and delete events
- Define complex recurrence rules for events
- View upcoming events in a list
- View all events in a calendar
- Search for events

For detailed setup and contributions, please view the README.md files in the backend and frontend folders!

THANKS!!!
